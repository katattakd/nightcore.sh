# Nightcore.sh
A Bash script that allows you to easily create "Nightcore" versions of songs.

## Features
- Creates visual effects (a gliding background and audio visualizer) using only FFMPEG.
- Applies advanced input filtering, to fix common issues (unnecessary silence, slight audio clipping, volume differences between songs) that would usually require manual editing.
- Designed to work with lossless files, by using lossless encoding in all processing steps. 
- Preserves audio quality whenever possible by avoiding resampling, using lossless formats and using the high quality SoX resampler whenever resampling is absoutely required.
- Preserves video quality whenever possible by using lossless formats and avoiding RGB to YUV conversion.
- Offers lossless 4k60fps output at tiny filesizes (typically under 48mbit/s bitrates).

## Dependencies
- GNU Coreutils or [untested] Busybox (for running the script)
- Bash (for running the script)
- FFMPEG (for encoding the video)
- SoX (for encoding the audio)
- Waifu2xcpp (for better image upscaling)

## Usage
Once dependencies are installed, download the script to your computer. Then, open the script, and adjust the built-in options as you see fit (there are options both at the beginning and the end of the script).

Once the script is configured, name your input files `input.flac` and `input.png`, and create a `speed.txt` file with a numeric speed multiplier (like `1.2`). Then run the script like so: `bash nightcore.sh`.

Useful speed multipliers range from 1.1 to 1.3, different songs will likely need to be set to different speeds.

When running the script, please make sure you have at least 4GB of available system RAM.
